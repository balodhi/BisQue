# Phenotiki Modules for BisQue

This repository contains the source code of the Phenotiki Analysis Software for BisQue.
Our cloud solution is structured as a suite of three web-based applications:
- *PhidiasAnnotate*: permits manual annotation of images to delineate plant regions;
- *PhidiasModel*: offers automated optimization of image analysis algorithm parameters, via a grid search on a training dataset of images and corresponding plant annotations (obtained for example with *PhidiasAnnotate*);
- *PhidiasAnalyze*: permits batch analysis of a dataset of time-lapse images of rosette plants and offers the possibility to visualize and export results.

The modules can be accessed at <http://bisque.iplantcollaborative.org> after signing in with proper user credentials.
