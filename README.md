# Phenotiki Modules for BisQue

This repository contains the source code of the Phenotiki Analysis Software for BisQue.
Our cloud solution is structured as a suite of three web-based applications:
- *PhidiasAnnotate*, permitting manual annotation of images to delineate plant regions;
- *PhidiasModel*, offering automated optimization of image analysis algorithm parameters, via a grid search on a training dataset of images and corresponding plant annotations (obtained e.g. with PhidiasAnnotate);
- *PhidiasAnalyze*, permitting batch analysis of a dataset of time-lapse images of plants and also visualization and exportation of the results.

The modules can be accessed at <http://bisque.iplantcollaborative.org> after signing in with proper user credentials.
